# UDEngine Unity Bullet Hell Engine

## Introduction  
Built on Unity3D and DOTween, UDEngine aims to be a minimal bullet-hell game engine, that features wide application and customization using callbacks as its own core.  

## Current State
This engine is still at its very early stage of development, with NO tweening added yet. Currently available modules are *Collision* and *Pool* modules (both are designed and implemented to boost performance)  

However, this early version could __STILL__ be useful. Using the wonderful DOTween library, you can already create wonderful Bullet Hell patterns, with certain collision events supplied to `Add\*Callbacks()` in `UBulletObject.GetActor()`. To see their actual usage, see `Example/Test` folder.  

The engine will use one or two awesome and useful plugins, which are NOT written by me. You can find the in the `Plugins/` folder. They will all be licenses as according to their own READMEs.  

I truly welcome people to come and test the engine, and hopefully contribute to the development.
